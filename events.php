                bi-monthly discussions and monthly seminars. These lectures begin with

              <p>A primary goal of SBA is to provide the means for our members to
              engage with industry leaders, powerful alumni, influential faculty, and
              other club members in the context of entering the industry. We achieve
              this through private networking events where members not only build
              connections, but practice and develop the networking skills
              necessary to succeed in business. We plans on networking with
              companies such as MorganStanley, Credit Suisse and Bank of
              American in the imminent future</p>
