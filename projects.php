          <b> <i> GOALS: </i> </b> <br>
          The foremost aim of the Sustainable Business Alliance is to create leaders
          for the futureâ€™s standard of business. This is primarily achieved through
          educating our members in sustainable financial literacy and competency, as well
          as encouraging specific career paths in management, finance, and other areas
          in which corporate sustainability can be usefully implemented.

             <p> <i> Colloboration with GAP INC.(NYC Location) </i> </p>
              <p>
                This is one of the first companies that SBA will be working with. Gap,
                Inc., known to many as one of the finer clothing places, has been faced
                with many charges due to the lack of their care for child labor and
                enforcing safety regulations for workers in factories. This has led to Gap
                facing many credibility issues which is affecting their
                market shares. Gap needs to focus on fixing their appareance
                so that these factors no longer affect their competitive advantage in the market
                and so that they can rise to the top again.

            <p> <i> Colloboration with Alpha Natural Resources </i> </p>
            <p>
              They are currently having many issues due to the fact that their internal
              operations has been releasing a lot of pollutants into the atmopshere.
              SBA hopes to work with this company and provide them with
              metrics that they can use to help solve many of the enviornmental issues they
              are having. One way in which SBA hopes to help this company is through their
              partnerships with environmental companies to give them a better image.

            <p> <i> Colloboration with Sustainable Analytics </i> </p>
            <p>This is another company that SBA plans to work with. They are a
               company that aims to help other companies evaluate their sustainability
               progress through the use of metrics. This Semester, SBA will work with this
                company in order to help them find companies who require environmental consultations.
                The company needs to think about how they can measure their
                progress in order to be successful.

          <blockquote> "The reason these companies were chosen by the team and
                       me because these companies are intersted in young college
                       students can use their intelligence to infleunce and change
                       the way in which GAP(even at it'small division) looks
                       at Sustainability. There is no "age" needed to make an
                       impact,just passion" <br/>

         <blockquote> "I have been a part of Consutling Clubs, and most of them
                       are pretty borad in scope. These projects are focused around
                      environmental consulting, so if you plan on going into that into
                       that field in the future, this is the perfect association for you"

         <blockquote> "Although some may think that a club can't make a big difference
                      in reducing their environmental issues, they coudln'y be more
                      wrong. Often times, is is very important to have a third party
                      person helping to solve environmental issues since that offers
                      new insight. And as interested as I am in enviromental finance,
                      I've realized that companies are excited by what students have to
                      offer since they realize that students are cheap and hardworking"<br/>
